Feature request (stevenglick@gmail.com):I would like to be able to set the columns while in the edit screen for any post type. Or at least a link to the settings page for the columns plugin.
I would also like to save different views of the different edit screens and quickly switch back and forth between views. Different views of the same edit tables would be useful for different purposes. 


I get an error on any custom field. Each row under the custom field outputs: The name column-meta-1 is already in use (I use the Custom Content Type plugin)

support custom fields hidden. fields that start with _ are saved without it. so _iamhidden will get stored in the options as plain iamhidden.
add share facebook, twitter icon in settings

bug: Hi, "Custom Field: Field Type: image" not preview for png file.

put column types in its own class

screencast how to use

bug report tool ( see custom-content-type-manager )

I would like to know if the 'Restore defaults' button applies to all the Post Types or only the current one.
If it is not possible to restore defaults for a post type only (Antoine)

problem: The only thing not working for me is attachments: the count doesn't show up, and the attachments themselves don't show up.
solution: images are saved in hidden custom fields. Make an option which let you choose hidden fields.

Unresolved Bugs

bug: sorry I'm not great with debugging PHP all I did was install a fresh version of wordpress 3.31 and the downloaded your plugin for the 'add plugins menu' it downloads fine but when I go to activate it my wordpress install falls over (white screen nothing loads). The only way I can fix is to remove the plugin from the plugins folder.
