done: add an role column to the all posts screen
done: add Posts Status column
done: Co-Authors Plus conflict: When any custom columns are set (Users columns or not), an extra empty 'Posts' column is added to the Users list table. solution is to give add_filter( "manage_users_columns") a higher priority.

bug: quick edit chages column layout.
solution: wp-posts-list-table.php line 481. Added columns are loaded into $columns. ( dependencies admin-ajax.php, list-table.php, inline-edit-post.dev.js )

bug: Hi, "Custom Field: Field Type: image" not preview for png file.
filtering by custom field: http://wpsnipp.com/index.php/functions-php/add-select-menu-to-filter-by-custom-field-in-admin/

is_column_meta() and get_stored_columns() and get_post_types() and get_meta_by_type() need to be in a utility class ( now they are double declared )

Meta data for Library, such as image_meta. There's an option to display meta data for Post, Pages and Users; but there's no equivalent for Media Gallery attachments.

comment wordcount + sorting by wordcount
width columns via http://quocity.com/colresizable/ (http://www.flexigrid.info/)
named class for the custom admin columns
doesn't work with columns from shopp 1.2
optional field to set the shown value as an edit-link for the entry (so you don't have to tick the checkbox and choose "edit" over the dropdown), because there's no link to click, if you unset the title
nice name for a numeric value. E.G. if 1 display open, if 2 display closed.

Third Party Plugins
---------------------------------------------------------
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/attachments/
problem: The only thing not working for me is attachments: the count doesn't show up, and the attachments themselves don't show up.
solution: images are saved in hidden custom fields. Make an option which let you choose hidden fields.

Unresolved Bugs
---------------------------------------------------------
bug: sorry I'm not great with debugging PHP all I did was install a fresh version of wordpress 3.31 and the downloaded your plugin for the 'add plugins menu' it downloads fine but when I go to activate it my wordpress install falls over (white screen nothing loads). The only way I can fix is to remove the plugin from the plugins folder.
