Lsoing options with serialized data

WordPress stores many options as "serialized data", which contains both the string content of things and their length. So when you modify the URL and the length changes, then the serialized data is no longer correct, and PHP rejects it.

Is there a way to filter each field before it gets outputted?

You can use the build in filters. Each column value is available though the 'cpac-link-column-result' filter. Example:

add_filter('cpac-posts-column-result', ' my_posts_result_filter ', 10, 4). 
function my_posts_result_filter( $result, $type, $column_name, $post_id) 
{
	if ( $result = 'yes' )
		$result = '<img src="' . get_bloginfo('template_url'). '/images/yes.jpg" alt="" />';
	
	return $result;
}

Above example will return an image (must be in your theme folder under images) instead of the word 'yes'.
